          <h1>Hi, I'm Dylan Kenniff.</h1>
          <p>I'm currently a second-year computer science student at Cornell University
            interested in software development. I am particularly interested in front-end
            development. When not programming, I love playing Ultimate Frisbee.

          <h3>OCaml "Settler's of Cornell" Game</h3>
          <p>Over the course of a semester, I worked in a group with two other
            students to develop a game similar to Settlers of Catan in OCaml.
            This project gave me valuable experience in developing an application from
            scratch in a team, using test-driven development. Development of
            this project included weekly team meetings with a project manager,
            two milestone demos of our progress, and development of a codebase of
            over 2000 lines of code.
          </p>

          <p>I was responsible for developing much of the player data and storage
            as well as much of the information necessary for each game, such as
            which player was active in the current turn and the the resources
            and structures that they owned. The part of this project that I am
            most proud of is the circular doubly-linked list module that I
            developed myself to store the players in the game as they are added.
            This closely mimics the circular nature of iterating through player
            turns in any turn-based game.
